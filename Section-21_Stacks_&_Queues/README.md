***STACKS***

***OBJECTIVES***
    - *Define what a stack is*
    - *Understand use cases for a stack*
    - *Implement operations on a stack data structure.*

***WHAT IS A STACK?***
    - *A LIFO data structure*
    - *LAST IN FIRST OUT*
    - *The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack*

***HOW IS IT USED?***
    - *Think about a stack of plates, or a stack of markers, or a stack of...anything.*
    - *As you pile it up the last thing (or the top-most thing) is what gets removed first.*

***WHERE STACKS ARE USED***
    - *Managing function invocations*
    - *Undo/Redo*
    - *Routing(the history object) is treated like a call stack*

***There is more than one way of implementing a stack.***
    - *Linked List Implementation*
    - *Array Implementation*

**PUSHING**
    - *Add a value to the top of a stack.*
**POP**
    - *Remove a value from the top of the stack.*


***RECAP***
    - *Stacks are a LIFO data structure where the last value in is always the first one out.*
    - *Stacks are used to handle function invocations (the call stack), for operations like undo/redo, and for routing (remember pages you have visited and go back/forward) and much more!*
    - *They are not a built in data structure in JavaScript, but are relatively simple to implement*
    - *Insert and remove are both O(1)*

***QUEUES***

***OBJECTIVES***
    - *Define what a queue is*
    - *Understand use cases for a queue*
    - *Implement operations on a queue data structure*

***WHAT IS A QUEUE?***
    - *A FIFO data structure*
    - *FIRST IN FIRST OUT*

***WHERE QUEUES ARE USED***
    - *Background Tasks*
    - *Uploading Resources*
    - *Printing/Task Processing*

***Enqueue***
    - *Adding to the beginning of a queue*
    - *Remember, queues are a FIFO data structure*

***Dequeue***
    - *Removing from the beginning of the Queue*
    - *Remember, queues are a FIFO data structure*

***RECAP***
    - *Queues are a FIFO data structure, all elements are first in first out.*
    - *Queues are useful for processing tasks and are foundational for more complex data structures*
    - *Insertion and Removal can be done in O(1)*
