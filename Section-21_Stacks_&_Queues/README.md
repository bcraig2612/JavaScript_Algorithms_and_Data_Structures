***OBJECTIVES***
    - *Define what a stack is*
    - *Understand use cases for a stack*
    - *Implement operations on a stack data structure.*

***WHAT IS A STACK?***
    - *A LIFO data structure*
    - *The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack*

***HOW IS IT USED?***
    - *Think about a stack of plates, or a stack of markers, or a stack of...anything.*
    - *As you pile it up the last thing (or the top-most thing) is what gets removed first.*

***WHERE STACKS ARE USED***
    - *Managing function invocations*
    - *Undo/Redo*
    - *Routing(the history object) is treated like a call stack*

***There is more than one way of implementing a stack.***
    - *Linked List Implementation*
    - *Array Implementation*

**PUSHING**
    - *Add a value to the top of a stack.*
**POP**
    - *Remove a value from the top of the stack.*


***RECAP***
    - *Stacks are a LIFO data structure where the last value in is always the first one out.*
    - *Stacks are used to handle function invocations (the call stack), for operations like undo/redo, and for routing (remember pages you have visited and go back/forward) and much more!*
    - *They are not a built in data structure in JavaScript, but are relatively simple to implement*
    - *Insert and remove are both O(1)*
