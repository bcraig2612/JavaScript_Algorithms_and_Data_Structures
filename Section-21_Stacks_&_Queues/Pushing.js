// The function should accept a value

// Create a new node with that value

// If there are no nodes in the stack, set the first and last property to be the newly created node

// If there is at least one node, create a variable that stores the current first property on the stack

// Reset the first property to be the newly created node

// Set the next property on the node to be the previously created variable

// Increment the size of the stack by 1
