***Graphs***
    **Objectives:**
        - *Explain what a graph is*
        - *Compare and contrast different types of graphs and their use cases in the real world*
        - *Implement a graph using an adjacency list*
        - *Traverse through a graph using BFS and DFS*
        - *Compare and contrast graph traversal algorithms*
    **What Are Graphs?**
        - *A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.*
        - *Nodes + Connections*
    **Uses For Graphs:**
        - *Social Networks*
        - *Location / Mapping*
        - *Routing Algorithms*
        - *Visual Hierarchy*
        - *File System Optimizations*
        - *EVERYWHERE!!!*
    **Essential Graph Terms:**
        - *Vertex - a node.*
        - *Edge - connection between nodes.*
        - *Weighted/Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices.*
        - *Directed/Undirected - directions assigned to distances between vertices.*
    **Adjacency Matrix:**
        - *Can take up less space (in sparse graphs)*
        - *Faster to iterate over all edges*
        - *Can be slower to lookup specific edge*
    **Adjacency List:**
        - *Takes up more space (in sparse graphs)*
        - *Slower to iterate over all edges*
        - *Faster to lookup specific edge*
    **What Will We Use?**
        - *ADJACENCY LIST!*
        - *Most data in the real-world tends to lend itself to sparser and/or larger graphs*
