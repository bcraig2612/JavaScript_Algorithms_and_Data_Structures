***INTERMEDIATE SORTING ALGORITHMS***
- *Faster Sorts*
  - *There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time          complexity from O(n  ) to O(n log n)*
  - *There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity*
  - *The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally      take longer to understand*


**MERGE-SORT**
- *It's a combination of two things - merging and sorting!*
- *Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted*
- *Works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements,    then building up a newly sorted array*
