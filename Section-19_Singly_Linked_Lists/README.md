***SINGLY LINKED LISTS***
    
    **Objectives**
        - *Define what a Singly Linked List is*
        - *Compare and contrast Linked Lists with Arrays*
        - *Implement insertion, removal and traversal methods on Singly Linked Lists*
    
    **What Is A Linked List?**
        - *A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.*
        - *Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null*
    
    **Comparison With Arrays:**
        - **Lists**
          - *Do not have indexes!*
          - *Connected via nodes with a next pointer*
          - *Random access is not allowed*
        - **Arrays**
          - *Indexed in order!*
          - *Insertion and deletion can be expensive*
          - *Can quickly be accessed at a specific index*

    **PUSHING**
        - *Adding a new node to the end of a linked list!*
  
    **POPPING**
        - *Removing a node from the end of a linked list!*

    **SHIFTING**
        - *Removing a new node from the beginning of the linked list!*

    **UNSHIFTING**
        - *Adding a new node to the beginning of a linked list!*

    **GET**
        - *Retrieving a node by it's position in the linked list!*

    **SET**
        - *Changing the value of a node based on it's position in the linked list*

    **INSERT**
        - *Adding a node to the linked list at a specific location*

    **REMOVE**
        - *Removing a node from the linked list at a specific position*

    **REVERSE**
        - *Reversing the linked list in place!*
  
  ***RECAP:***
    - *Singly Linked Lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required*
    - *Arrays contain a built in index whereas Linked Lists do not*
    - *The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like Stacks and Queues*
