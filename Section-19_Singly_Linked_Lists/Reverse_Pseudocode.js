// Swap the head and tail

// Create a variable called next

// Create a variable called prev

// Create a variable called node and initialize it to the head property

// Loop through the list

// Set next to be the next property on whatever node is

// Set the next property on the node to be whatever prev is

// Set prev to be the value of the node variable

// Set the node variable to be the value of the next variable

// Once you have finished looping, return the list
