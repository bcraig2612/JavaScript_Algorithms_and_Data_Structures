***OBJECTIVES***
    - *Construct a Doubly Linked List*
    - *Compare and contrast Doubly and Singly Linked Lists*
    - *Implement basic operations on a Doubly Linked List*

**WE KNOW WHAT LISTS ARE...BUT DOUBLY?**
    - *Almost identical to Singly Linked Lists, except every node has another pointer, to the previous node!*

**COMPARISON WITH SINGLY LINKED LISTS**
    - *More memory === More Flexibility*
    - *It's almost always a tradeoff!*

**PUSHING**
    - *Adding a node to the end of the Doubly Linked List*

**POPPING**
    - *Removing a node from the end of a Doubly Linked List*

**SHIFTING**
    - *Removing a node from the beginning of the Doubly Linked List*

**UNSHIFTING**
    - *Adding a node to the beginning of the Doubly Linked List*

**GET**
    - *Accessing a node in a Doubly Linked List by its position*

**SET**
    - *Replacing the value of a node to the in a Doubly Linked List*

**INSERT**
    - *Adding a node in a Doubly Linked List by a certain position*

**REMOVE**
    - *Removing a node in a Doubly Linked List by a certain position*

**REVERSE**
    - *Reversing a Doubly Linked List in place!*

***RECAP!***
    - *Doubly Linked Lists are almost identical to Singly Linked Lists except there is an additional pointer to previous nodes*
    - *Better than Singly Linked Lists for finding nodes and can be done in half the time!*
    - *However, they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer*
    - *Doubly linked lists are used to implement other data structures and certain types of caches*
