***WHAT IS SORTING?***
    - *Sorting is a process of rearranging the items in a collection (an    array) so that the items are in some specific order.*
    - *EXAMPLES:* 
      - *Sorting numbers from smallest to largest*
      - *Sorting names alphabetically*
      - *Sorting movies based on the release year*
      - *Sorting movies based on total revenue*


**WHY DO WE NEED TO LEARN THIS?**
    - *Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it    works.*
    - *There are many different ways to sort things, and different          techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages.*
    - *Classic Interview Problem/Question*


**TELLING JAVASCRIPT HOW TO SORT:**
    - *The built-in sort method accepts an optional comparator function*
    - *You can use this comparator function to tell JavaScript how you      want to sort it.*
    - *The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines      their sort order based on the return value.*
      - *If it returns a negative number, a should come before b*
      - *If it returns a positive number, a should come after b*
      - *If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is        concerned*


***BUBBLE SORT***
- *A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top!*
- *Bubble Sort Big O Complexity: In General it's O(n * n), if the items     are almost sorted or are already sorted it would be O(n)*
